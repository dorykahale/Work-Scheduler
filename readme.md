This Work Scheduler displays current day/time with blocks of hours, which upon clicking into, become areas for users to input text that can be saved to local storage for later retrieval.

The head displays the user's current date and time.

Depending on the user's local time, hours of the day are displayed in blocks representing hours passed, hours ahead, and current hour in different colors.

After the users inputs text, the save button on that hour block must be clicked for that event to be saved to local storage and be retrievable later despite any page refreshes.
